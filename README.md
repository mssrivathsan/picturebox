<h1>How To Implement</h1>
This plugin is very easy to implement. Just make sure that the images folder, picturebox.js and picturebox.css files are on the same directory.

<pre>
  &lt;link rel = "stylesheet" href = "includes/picturebox.css"&gt;
  &lt;script src = "includes/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src = "includes/picturebox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;div class = "lightbox"&gt;
    //Your Images Here
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

To put it much simpler just wrap every image that you want to view in the lightbox with a div of class lightbox. Simple as that !
